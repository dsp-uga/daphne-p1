# daphne-p1 | CSCI 8360 Data Science Practicum Spring 2021 : Malware Classifier
## Goal
To develop a machine learning pipeline that classifies malware (input as byte strings) as accurately as possible.

## Getting Started
These instructions describe the prerequisites and steps to get the project up and running.

## Setup
This project can be easily set up on the Google Cloud Platform, using their Dataproc service for batch processing. Learn about Dataproc here https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/overview .

We recommend you setup a virtual environment and install the software listed in requirements.txt. We use Python version 3.7.

## Usage

## Features
Yet to be fully determined, however soem potential features include:
- Basic word count
- Bigram count
- Relative word frequency
- Relative bigram frequency

where word counts are, by default, adjusted using additive smoothing.
## Output

## Directories
- ###datasets: 
  contains much smaller subsets of our final training and testing datasets for setup and initial experiments
- ###features: 
  csv files containing the features we find for our malware data
- ###notebooks: 
  jupyter notebook python files, .jnb
- ###output 
  files with results as output from experiments
